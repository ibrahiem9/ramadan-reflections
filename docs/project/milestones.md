- [ ] Set up version control with GitHub/GitLab.
- [ ] Configure development tools:
  - ESLint, Prettier, and Husky for code quality.
  - CI/CD pipeline using Vercel or Netlify for frontend, and AWS Lambda/Firebase for backend.
- [ ] Document dependencies, goals, and the development process in a `README.md`.

### **Milestone 2: Countdown Timer**
- [ ] Create the **frontend component** for the countdown timer.
